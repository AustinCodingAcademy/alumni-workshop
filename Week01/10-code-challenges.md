1) FizzBuzz: “Write a script, or function, that prints out every number from 0-100. However, if that number is devisable by 3, print “Fizz” instead. Also, if the number is devisable by 5, print “Buzz” instead. AND, If the number is devisable by both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”.” 

2) Reverse: “Write a function that will return any string in the reverse order.”

3) Anagram: “Write a function that takes two strings, s1 and s2. If s1 is represented in any permutation within s2, return true, otherwise return false. Note: s2 can be longer”
- Example 1: s1=“car”, s2=“racetrack”, Example 2: s1=“sun”, s2=“underside”

4) Palindrome: “Write a function that takes a string and returns true if it’s a palindrome.”
- Example 1: “Hannah”, Example 2: “thought”,

5) Longest: “Write a function that returns the longest string in an array. Note: no built-in methods”
- Example: [‘Hello’,’my’,’name’,’is’,’Samantha’]

6) Fibonacci: “Write a function that prints the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Start by printing the 3rd number; with the first number set to 0, and the second number set to 1. Note: the fibonacci sequence simply ads the previous two numbers together to determine the third.”

7) Prime: “Write a program that prints the first 100 prime numbers”

8) Vowels: “Write a function that returns the number of vowels in the given string. Just use a,e,i,o,u for this case. Note: no built-in methods”
	-	Example: “Tuesday”

9) Sort: “Write a function that takes an array of unsorted numbers and returns them sorted.” 
	-	Example: [8,4,6,1,9,2].

10) Shuffle: “Create an array with 52 indexes, make each value represent each card in a dec of cards. Create a function called  shuffle’ that takes an array and returns it shuffled randomly.” 
 - Example: ['2-h','3-h','4-h','5-h','6-h','7-h','8-h','9-h','10-h','j-h','q-h','k-h','a-h','2-c','3-c','4-c','5-c','6-c','7-c','8-c','9-c','10-c','j-c','q-c','k-c','a-c','2-d','3-d','4-d','5-d','6-d','7-d','8-d','9-d','10-d','j-d','q-d','k-d','a-d','2-s','3-s','4-s','5-s','6-s','7-s','8-s','9-s','10-s','j-s','q-s','k-s']
